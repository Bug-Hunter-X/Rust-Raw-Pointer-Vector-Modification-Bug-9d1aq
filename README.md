This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving unsafe code and raw pointers. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to modify a vector through a raw pointer after the vector's internal data has been reallocated. This leads to undefined behavior because the pointer is no longer valid. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version of the code using safe Rust techniques.
